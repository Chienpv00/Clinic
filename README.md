# Clinic website - Use AI Effectively

## 1. Initial planning and research
>promt: You’re a website designer and you have a client that owns a clinic booking website. They want a simple website that displays the images of the clinic, clinic services and a page for people to make an apointement. How would you go about building this?

### Step 1: Understand Client Needs
Before writing any code, get clarity on:
- Clinic name, logo, and brand colors
- Images of the clinic (interior, staff, location)
- List of services (with descriptions and pricing if needed)
- Appointment form fields (e.g., Name, Phone, Date, Time, Service, Doctor)

--- 

Clinic name, logo, and brand colors:
- Bình Thu
- logo:
- brand color: red, blue, white
Images of the clinic (interior, staff, location):

List of services (with descriptions and pricing if needed):

Appointment form fields (e.g., Name, Phone, Date, Time, Service, Doctor)

### Step 2: Choose the Tech Stack
Frontend + Backend: nextjs

Database: relation database

Hosting: vercel

###  Step 3: Plan the Pages

Design a clean 3–4 page layout:
- Home Page

  - Welcome message

  - Clinic intro

  - Hero image of the clinic

  - "Book Appointment" button

- Services Page

  - Grid layout listing each service

  - Name, image/icon, description, price

  - Gallery Page

  - Slideshow or grid of clinic photos

- Appointment Page

  - Form with validation

  - Optional: calendar/time picker

  - Success message or redirect after submission
### Step 4: Design the UI
Use Figma or wireframe tools to create mockups. Keep it:

Clean and professional

Accessible (good contrast, readable fonts)

Responsive (mobile-first design)

### Step 5: Build the Website


### Step 6: Test and Deploy
Test responsiveness on desktop and mobile

Test form submission and success/error states

Deploy via Netlify, Vercel, or your client’s hosting
###  Optional Features for Later

Admin dashboard for managing appointments

Email/SMS confirmation for users

Online payment or insurance handling

Doctor profiles & availability calendar

>prompt: From the above, Generate the wireframes of what the entire website with its pages will look like.

## Step 2: Design and UI Copy
 I've got a rough idea of the layout. Time to turn these ugly wireframes into a real design. For this, I use AI-powered UI generation tools (you can find a few out there, like https://stitch.withgoogle.com, or even use v0.dev to get ideas).

I just uploaded the wireframes from ChatGPT and told it what I wanted.

## Step 3: Writing the Boilerplate Code

Use cursor
Prompt:

You are a senior React developer. Convert the following HTML and Tailwind CSS code into a fully functional React application.

Requirements:

Use Vite as the build tool.

The project must be in TypeScript.

Implement the UI components using shadcn/ui where appropriate (for example, Buttons, Cards).

Use lucide-react for icons

Structure the code into logical components (for example, Navbar, CarCard, Footer).

Create a root App.tsx file that assembles these components

## Step 4: Making the Code Actually Good
Look, I know this is far from done. The AI gave me a great start, but it's not a finished product. I still have to plug in a CMS or a database, set up the real logic – you get the idea. This is where the real development starts, and AI is still my co-pilot.

What the AI Got Right (and Wrong)
The AI did a surprisingly good job on the first pass. It correctly scaffolded the Vite + React + TS project, created a components folder, and even used shadcn/ui components where I asked. This saved me at least 30-45 minutes of tedious setup.

But it wasn't perfect. For example, the initial data for the cars was hardcoded directly inside the component. That's a huge no-no for a real app that needs to scale or pull from a database. Also, the components weren't as reusable as I'd like.

This is where your job as a developer comes in – to review, refactor, and architect properly.
